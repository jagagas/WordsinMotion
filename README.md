# Project 2: Words in Motion
by Jenny Agagas

# project overview 

My project is based on the song "Who Run the World (Girls)" by Beyonc√©. The message of this song is to empower women and affirm that women are strong and powerful. It is an anthem for girls all around the world. When this song came out when I was a kid, I thought it was so exciting in how it celebrated women.

For my website, I chose to focus on the lyrics from the pre-chorus leading up to the chorus. The tempo in the pre-chorus slowly builds up to the electric chant in the chorus, "Who run the world? Girls." There is so much imagery and hope in the lyrics leading into the chorus; I wanted to experiment with those elements and their tempo. I wanted "persuasion" to feel slow and enticing, "nation" to grow, and "Girls" to jump off the screen.

My project is a reflection of the feelings of empowerment and womanhood that this song delivers.

# technical overview

The project includes 11 HTML pages and a single CSS page. The first page starts off gently like the song. Animations I used were type and grow timed to where the animations happen one after the other.

Page 2 includes the words "power" and "love," two very dominant words. I chose to make power grow and love to rotate around to highlight their importance.

Page 3 is the last line before the chorus, "we can devour." I chose to slowly position these words one by one onto the center of the screen leading into the chorus.

"Who run the world?" is positioned large in the center with a light shadow illuminating behind it. The song is made up of half of these lines and I designed it with the intention to make it bold and catchy. Then "Girls" appears in bold pink and grows in size to mimic a shout.

The rest of the project goes back and forth from "Who run the world?" and "Girls."

Page 10 is the credits title and restart button to play again.

My color palette consists of pink, red, and yellow. I chose these colors because they are bold and bright. Red is a powerful color and I wanted to complement that with hot pink and yellow.

# acknowledgment 

During this project, I referenced W3School for CSS transitions and animations. The "try it yourself" feature on their website helped a lot to visualize how the code would work in my project.

Additionally, I rewatched most of the zoom recordings, like the stars and bugs demo, to gain a better understanding of the elements. I also used the CSS cheat PDFs alongside my work.

I also found it really helpful to reference and learn from the past student examples such as Jose's and Zanett's project.
